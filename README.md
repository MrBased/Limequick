# About Limequick 🍋
Without Limequick the process goes like this:
- Download the essay to be assessed 💤
- Download the template to write positive and negative feedback (.docx) 😫
- Save the template with the comments as PDF 😢
- Use PDF editing tools to merge the essay and your feedback PDFs 😴
- Rename the merged result PDF to match the initial file name of the essay (which is an encoded hard to follow string) 💀
- Upload to the official platform and assign a score ⚰️

Guess what... this steps are followed **TWICE** every week with a single day deadline!

With Limequick this nightmare ENDS 🥳:
- Download the essay and upload it to Limequick web app 🌈
- Write your feedback in the text fields 💡
- Click to download the file with all requirements met 🌞
- Upload to the official platform and assign score 🏁
